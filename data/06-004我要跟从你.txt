I will follow Him
我要跟随你

Lamb of God—our dear Redeeming One is Christ!
For our sins He paid the highest price
To redeem and to recover us
Who were lost and fallen far from God.
As the Lamb, He had no blemish;
He was meek, even submissive.
How can we like Him obedient be
Unto death, that even of the cross?
神的羔羊，我们亲爱的救赎者就是基督!
他为我们的罪付出了最高的代价
来救赎和挽回我们
我们迷失了方向，远离上帝。
他像羔羊一样，毫无瑕疵；
他温柔谦卑，
以致死在十字架上
我们也要效法他


I want to follow Him,
Rest from all my wandering,
End all my endeavoring;
Even though I know not where or
How—I know He cares!
I know He'll never err; I know He'll lead me well.
I know His voice; this now my choice—
Follow where the Lamb would lead.
我要跟随他，
不再流浪，
不再靠自己;
即使我不知道未来的道路
但我知道他在乎！
我知道他永不会错，我知道他能很好地引导我。
我认得他的声音，他是我的选择
跟随羔羊指引的方向。

When He came, though many followed in the way,
Few remained who knew Him and His ways.
Lamb of God—He took the narrow gate;
The constricted way to life He traced;
Sacrificed, though men denied Him;
Gave His life, though men forsook Him.
How can we t'ward Him still hardened be
When to us He gave all selflessly?
耶稣来的时候、路上跟随他的虽多、
认识他的却寥寥无几。
上帝的羔羊，他走窄门，
他走窄路;
虽然人不认他，却甘愿成为祭物。
他献出了自己的生命，尽管人们离弃他。
我们怎能心再冰冷
他已无私地奉献了一切

Lord we pray, preserve us faithful in the way
All our days, never to fall away.
By Your grace, keep us pursuing You,
Taking up the cross to follow You.
Consecrate we unreservedly,
Absolute for You entirely.
In our hearts, Lord, let the highways be
Unto Zion single-heartedly.
主，保守我们路上有忠心
我们在世永不失脚掉队。
借着祢的恩典，让我们不断追求你，
背起十字架跟随你。
我们也毫无保留地奉献，
完完全全只为你。
在我们心中，主啊，让永生成为
我们唯一的盼望。

Now we will follow Him!
To His call we're answering,
All we are we're offering.
New Jerusalem we see
Come down from heav'n to earth!
God and man mingled now, our oneness we avow
Eternally, O gloriously!
This is where the Lamb would lead!
现在就要跟随他!
回应他的召唤
献上我们的一切。
我们看到了圣城
从天上降到人间!
上帝与人和好，
直到永远！荣耀归给主！
这就是羔羊引导我们的方向！
