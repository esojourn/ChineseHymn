成为我异象 - Be Thou My Vision

Be thou my vision o lord of my heart

Naught be all else to me save that thou art

Thou my best thought by day or by night

Waking or sleeping thy presence my light

Be thou my wisdom and thou my true word

I ever with thee and thou with me lord

Thou my great father I thy true son

Thou in me dwelling and I with thee one

Riches I heed not nor man s empty praise

Thou mine inheritance now and always

Thou and thou only first in my heart

High king of heaven my treasure thou art

High king of heaven my victory won

May I reach heaven joys o bright heaven sun

Heart of my own heart what e er befall

Still be my vision o ruler of all

Heart of my own heart what e er befall

Still be my vision o ruler of all
