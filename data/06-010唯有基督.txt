1
In Christ alone my hope is found;
惟有基督赐我盼望，
He is my light, my strength, my song;
祂是光芒诗歌力量；
This cornerstone, this solid ground,
祂是盘石稳固根基，
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
患难风暴坚定不移。
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
慈爱至高平安至深，
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
驱散恐惧平静风浪！
My comforter, my all in all—
我的安慰我的一切，
Here in the love of Christ I stand.
在基督里我能站立。

2
In Christ alone, Who took on flesh,
惟有基督道成肉身，
Fullness of God in helpless babe!
全权之神成为婴孩！
This gift of love and righteousness,
从天赐下慈爱公义，
Scorned by the ones He came to save.
却被世人拒绝厌弃。
Till on that cross as Jesus died,
被钉十架流血舍身，
The wrath of God was satisfied;
父神公义终得满足；
For ev'ry sin on Him was laid—
基督承担所有罪愆，
Here in the death of Christ I live.
祂以死亡赐我生命。

3
There in the ground His body lay,
祂被安葬在坟墓里，
Light of the world by darkness slain;
世上之光黑暗吞没；
Then bursting forth in glorious day,
荣耀之日冲破幽暗，
Up from the grave He rose again!
脱离死亡救主复活。
And as He stands in victory,
因他复活因他得胜，
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me;
我才脱离罪恶毒钩；
For I am His and He is mine—
我属基督基督属我，
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.
宝血重价将我买赎。

4
No guilt in life, no fear in death—
不被定罪不惧死亡，
This is the pow'r of Christ in me;
基督大能在我里面；
From life's first cry to final breath,
从我诞生直到离世，
Jesus commands my destiny.
我的一生基督掌权。
No pow'r of hell, no scheme of man,
黑暗权势恶人计谋，
Can ever pluck me from His hand;
无法将我与主隔绝；
Till He returns or calls me home—
直到主来或召我去。
Here in the pow'r of Christ I'll stand.”
靠主全能我永站立！
