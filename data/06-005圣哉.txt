圣哉！圣哉！圣哉！ - Holy holy holy

Holy holy holy

Lord god almighty

Early in the morning our song shall rise to thee

Holy holy holy

Merciful and mighty

God in three persons blessed trinity

Holy holy holy

Though the darkness hide thee

Though the eye of sinful man thy glory may not see

Only thou art holy there is none beside thee

Perfect in power in love and purity

Holy holy holy

Lord god almighty

All thy works shall praise thy name in earth and sky and sea

Holy holy holy

Merciful and mighty

God in three persons blessed trinity

God in three persons blessed trinity
