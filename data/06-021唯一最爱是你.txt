唯一最爱是你 - My best love Thou art

1 Jesus Lord, my best love Thou art,
Thou hast fully captured my heart;
There is none in heav’n nor on earth like Thee,
With thy beauty none can compete
When Thy voice first came to my ear,
Whisp’ring in my heart words most dear,
All past loves and aims lost their charm for me,
All my boasts so vain now appear.
Throughout all the world, who compares with Thee?
Who so full of worth, who so fair and sweet?
Only Thou art worthy my love to win,
Oh Lord Jesus , How I love Thee!
No more I who live, no more self-deceived,
No more in the self’s, world indulged to be,
Deep within I know you’re my only love,
My best love in none else but Thee!

2 Jesus Lord, my best love Thou art,
Rid all rocks that hide in my heart;
Gladly I Thy bondslave of love would be,
One heart, one will ever with Thee
Though my heart is oft not subdued, ,
Still Thy way alone it would choose;
All I yearn for is what Thy heart desires,
In Thy love alone peace I find.
Throughout all the world, who compares with Thee?
Who so full of worth, who so fair and sweet?
Only Thou art worthy my love to win,
Oh Lord Jesus , How I love Thee!
No more I who live, no more self-deceived,
No more in the self’s, world indulged to be,
Deep within I know you’re my only love,
My best love in none else but Thee!

3 Jesus Lord, my best love Thou art;
Ne’er again from Thee I’d depart;
Never hide Thy dear, smiling face from me.
To none else I’d cling Lord, but Thee.
To Thee, Lord, my all I outpour,
How Thy love my heart deeply fills,
My eternal portion, mosr precious Lord,
None but Thee I want evermore.
Throughout all the world, who compares with Thee?
Who so full of worth, who so fair and sweet?
Only Thou art worthy my love to win,
Oh Lord Jesus , How I love Thee!
No more I who live, no more self-deceived,
No more in the self’s, world indulged to be,

* Deep within I know you’re my only love,
My best love in none else but Thee!
