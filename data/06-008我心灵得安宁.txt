我心灵得安宁 - It Is Well with My Soul

When peace like a river attendeth my way
When sorrows like sea billows roll
What ever my lot thou hast taught me to say
It is well it is well with my soul
It is well
With my soul
It is well it is well with my soul

Though satan should buffet though trials should come
Let this blest assurance control
That christ has regarded my helpless estate
And hath shed his own blood for my soul
It is well it is well
With my soul with my soul
It is well it is well with my soul

My sin oh the bliss of this glorious thought
My sin not in part but the whole
Is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more
Praise the lord praise the lord my soul
It is well it is well
With my soul with my soul
It is well it is well with my soul
It is well it is well
With my soul with my soul
It is well it is well with my soul
