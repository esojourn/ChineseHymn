Lamb of God—our dear Redeeming One is Christ!
For our sins He paid the highest price
To redeem and to recover us
Who were lost and fallen far from God.
As the Lamb, He had no blemish;
He was meek, even submissive.
How can we like Him obedient be
Unto death, that even of the cross?
神的羔羊，我们亲爱的救赎者就是基督!
他为我们的罪付出了最高的代价
来救赎和挽回我们
他们迷失了方向，远离上帝。
他像羔羊一样，毫无瑕疵;
他很温顺，甚至很顺从。
我们怎么能像他那样听话呢
甚至死在十字架上?

I want to follow Him,
Rest from all my wandering,
End all my endeavoring;
Even though I know not where or
How—I know He cares!
I know He'll never err; I know He'll lead me well.
I know His voice; this now my choice—
Follow where the Lamb would lead.
我要跟随他，
从我所有的流浪中休息，
结束我的一切努力;
即使我不知道在哪里，或者
我知道他在乎!
我知道他永远不会犯错;我知道他会很好地领导我。
我认得他的声音;这是我的选择
跟随羔羊指引的方向。

When He came, though many followed in the way,
Few remained who knew Him and His ways.
Lamb of God—He took the narrow gate;
The constricted way to life He traced;
Sacrificed, though men denied Him;
Gave His life, though men forsook Him.
How can we t'ward Him still hardened be
When to us He gave all selflessly?
耶稣来的时候、路上跟随他的虽多、
认识他和他行事方式的人寥寥无几。
上帝的羔羊，他走窄门;
他追寻狭窄的生活方式;
被献祭了，虽然人不认他。
他献出了自己的生命，尽管人们离弃了他。
我们怎么能容忍他还是那么冷酷无情呢
他什么时候无私地奉献给我们?

Lord we pray, preserve us faithful in the way
All our days, never to fall away.
By Your grace, keep us pursuing You,
Taking up the cross to follow You.
Consecrate we unreservedly,
Absolute for You entirely.
In our hearts, Lord, let the highways be
Unto Zion single-heartedly.
祷告主，保佑我们在道路上有忠心
我们所有的日子，永不凋零。
借着祢的恩典，使我们不断追求祢，
背起十字架跟随你。
我们毫无保留地奉献,
绝对为你完全。
在我们心中，主啊，让道路在我们心中
对锡安诚心的。

Now we will follow Him!
To His call we're answering,
All we are we're offering.
New Jerusalem we see
Come down from heav'n to earth!
God and man mingled now, our oneness we avow
Eternally, O gloriously!
This is where the Lamb would lead!
现在我们要跟随他!
我们在回应他的召唤
我们所提供的一切。
我们看到了新耶路撒冷
从天堂到人间来吧!
上帝和人类现在融合了，我们承认我们是一体的
光荣啊,永远!
这就是羔羊会去的地方!
