耶稣深爱 - Oh the deep deep love of jesus

Oh the deep deep love of jesus

Vast unmeasured boundless free

Rolling as a mighty ocean

In its fullness over me

Underneath me all around me

Is the current of your love

Leading onward leading homeward

To your glorious rest above

Oh the deep deep love of jesus

Tis heaven of heavens to me

And it lifts me up to glory

For it lifts me up to thee

Oh the deep deep love of jesus

Spread his praise from shore to shore

How he loves us ever loves us

Changes never nevermore
