神要开道路

God will make a way
神要开道路
Where there seems to be no way
在旷野无路之处
He works in ways we cannot see
虽看不见 衪也看顾
He will make a way for me
祂要为我开道路
He will be my guide
祂是我引导
Hold me closely to His side
领我靠近祂怀抱
With love and strength for each new day
爱和力量 日日帮助
He will make a way, He will make a way
祂要开道路 祂要开道路
Oh, God will make a way

Where there seems to be no way
在旷野无路之处
He works in ways we cannot see

祂要开道路 祂要开道路
By a roadway in the wilderness, He'll lead me
祂必在旷野里开道路 引领我
And rivers in the desert will I see
在沙漠中开江河供应我
Heaven and Earth will fade but His Word will still remain
天地将要废去 但祂话语永长存
And He will do something new today
